# ARM Cortex-M Assembly Tutorials

These folders each contain their own README files, but the gist is that I feel like there's not very much information on getting started with programming these microprocessors, and I feel like assembly isn't a bad way to learn. It might even be a good way to teach general programming, since you can introduce the idea of a program as a list of instructions straight-away.

Anyways, a lot of minimal C examples which are available have big chunks of confusing 'magic' code and numbers, so hopefully these examples can help break those concepts down.

Not everything written here is guaranteed to be accurate; I'm just going off of my understanding as I learn more about these Cortex-M processors. Let me know if I get stuff wrong!
